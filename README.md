# Raksha Pipes Data Management and Visualization System 

In this project, we embark on a comprehensive journey to construct a robust data management and visualization system tailored for Raksha Pipes. Our objective is to develop an end-to-end solution encompassing data generation, database creation, and dashboard construction. Leveraging advanced technologies and methodologies, we aim to empower Raksha Pipes with actionable insights derived from the data, facilitating informed decision-making and enhancing operational efficiency. Through meticulous documentation and a comprehensive presentation, we will illustrate the intricacies of our process and showcase the impactful outcomes achieved.


# Project Overview:

In this project, we will:

Generate synthetic data for various entities such as customers, orders, payments, products, shippers, suppliers, order details, and categories.

Convert the generated data into CSV files for easy storage and manipulation.

Create a MySQL database named raksha_pipes to store the generated data.

Load the data from CSV files into the respective tables of the raksha_pipes database.

Connect the raksha_pipes database to Power BI for dashboard creation.

Create visualizations in Power BI to analyze customer distribution, supplier analysis, shipping analysis, popular payment methods, sales by category, and top customers.


# Project Structure
Data Generation: Synthetic data for various entities is generated using Faker and random libraries in Python.

CSV File Creation: The generated data is converted into CSV files using pandas DataFrames for further processing and storage.

MySQL Database Creation: A MySQL database named raksha_pipes is created to store the generated data.
Data Loading: The data from CSV files is loaded into the respective tables of the raksha_pipes database.

Power BI Dashboard Creation: The raksha_pipes database is connected to Power BI, and visualizations are created to analyze various aspects of the data.
#Dashboard Visualizations

Distribution of Customers: Visualizes the geographical distribution of customers based on their cities or countries.

Supplier Analysis: Provides insights into supplier performance, including total sales, products supplied, and geographical distribution.

Shipping Analysis: Analyzes shipping-related metrics such as delivery times, shipping costs, and shipping methods.

Popular Payment Methods: Highlights the most frequently used payment methods by customers.

Sales by Category: Breaks down sales data by product categories to identify the most profitable product categories.

Top Customers: Identifies the top customers based on their total purchase amounts or frequency of purchases.
